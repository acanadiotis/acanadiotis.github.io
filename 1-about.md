I work as a post-doctoral researcher at the [Data Intensive Applications and Systems (DIAS)](https://dias.epfl.ch) lab of the [School of Computer and Communication Sciences](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/), [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch).
I obtained my doctorate of engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, whereas before joining DIAS, I spent sixteen months at the University of Catania where I worked on the Internet of Things.
My current research aims in enabling fast and predictable data management systems.
To achieve this, I separate query execution from resource scheduling and I optimise the first for speed and the second for providing adaptivity and tight performance bounds.
My vision is to enable query execution at extreme scale over today's heterogeneous network infrastructure.
