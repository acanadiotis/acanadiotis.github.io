I am Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu), member of the [CEDAR](https://team.inria.fr/cedar) team.
Before, I worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the DIAS lab of the [School of Computer and Communication Sciences](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/), [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch).
I obtained my doctorate of engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, whereas before joining DIAS, I spent sixteen months at the University of Catania where I worked on the Internet of Things.
My research focuses on resource management and execution models for data management systems in the face of heterogeneous workloads and data layouts. Currently, I am working on data management systems which combine relational, graph and machine learning processing pipelines.
